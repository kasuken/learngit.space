            <p><strong>Mission Phase 7</strong> • Difficulty: Beginner</p>
        </div>

        <article>
            <h2>Your Connection to Earth</h2>
            
            <p>You've learned about Git—your spacecraft's local navigation system. Now meet GitHub—mission control on Earth. While your spacecraft (Git) operates independently, mission control (GitHub) provides collaboration, backup, and coordination with the global space program.</p>

            <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
            
            <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. Think of it as:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A backup station:</strong> Your code is safely stored in the cloud</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration hub:</strong> Teams work together on shared projects</li>
                <li><strong>LearnGit.space -</strong> Coordinate with developers worldwide</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Showcase your work to potential employers</li>
                <li><strong>Open-source archive:</strong> Access millions of free, open projects</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>GitHub vs Git: The Relationship</h2>
            
            <p>Understanding this distinction is crucial:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Git:</strong> Version control software you run locally</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> Web service that hosts Git repositories</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Git works perfectly without GitHub. But GitHub adds powerful features for collaboration and backup. Alternatives include GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gitea, but GitHub is the most popular.</p>

            <h2>Why Developers Love GitHub</h2>

            <h3>Collaboration at Scale</h3>
            <p>GitHub allows thousands of developers to work on the same project. Linux, React, TensorFlow—massive projects with contributors worldwide—all coordinate through GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
            <p>Propose changes to projects. Other developers review your code, suggest improvements, and merge it when ready. It's like submitting mission plans for peer review before execution.</p>

            <h3>Issues and Project Management</h3>
            <p>Track bugs, plan features, and manage tasks. Every problem gets an issue number, discussion thread, and resolution tracking.</p>

            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>README files, wikis, and GitHub Pages let you document projects beautifully. Good documentation is as important as good code.</p>

            <h3>Social Coding</h3>
            <p>Follow developers, star projects you like, fork repositories to customize them. It's a social network for code.</p>

            <h2>Creating Your GitHub Account</h2>
            
            <p>Ready to join mission control? Let's create your account:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Visit <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a></li>
                <li>Click "Sign up"</li>
                <li>Enter your email, password, and username</li>
                <li>Verify you're human (captcha)</li>
                <li>Verify your email address</li>
                <li>Choose free plan (plenty for learning and personal projects)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="mission-brief">
                <h3>Choosing Your Username</h3>
                <p>Your GitHub username is your professional identity. Choose wisely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it professional (employers will see it)</li>
                    <li>Make it memorable</li>
                    <li>Avoid numbers unless they're meaningful</li>
                    <li>Consider using your real name if available</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Key GitHub Concepts</h2>

            <h3>Repositories</h3>
            <p>Each project is a repository. It contains all files, history, and collaboration tools. Repositories can be public (anyone can see) or private (invitation only).</p>

            <h3>Remote vs Local</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local repository:</strong> On your computer (Git)</li>
                <li><strong>Remote repository:</strong> On GitHub's servers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You'll sync between them with push (upload) and pull (download) commands.</p>

            <h3>Cloning</h3>
            <p>Download a complete copy of a repository to your computer. You get all files and complete history.</p>

            <h3>Forking</h3>
            <p>Create your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. You can modify it freely without affecting the original.</p>

            <h3>Stars and Watching</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Star:</strong> Bookmark projects you like</li>
                <li><strong>Watch:</strong> Get notifications about project updates</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>GitHub's Interface</h2>

            <h3>Dashboard</h3>
            <p>Your home base showing recent activity, repositories, and recommendations.</p>

            <h3>Profile</h3>
            <p>Your public identity. Shows your repositories, contributions, and activity. Employers often check GitHub profiles!</p>

            <h3>Explore</h3>
            <p>Discover trending projects, topics, and collections.</p>

            <h2>The Power of Open Source</h2>
            
            <p>GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects. This means:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Free access to incredible software</li>
                <li>Learn from professional code</li>
                <li>Contribute to projects used by millions</li>
                <li>Build your reputation and skills</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Many famous projects are on GitHub: Linux kernel, Visual Studio Code, React, TensorFlow, Python, and thousands more.</p>

            <h2>GitHub for Learning</h2>
            
            <p>GitHub is an incredible learning resource:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Read code from experienced developers</li>
                <li>See how large projects are structured</li>
                <li>Study commit messages to understand decision-making</li>
                <li>Follow development discussions in issues and pull requests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>GitHub Features You'll Use</h2>

            <h3>README.md</h3>
            <p>The front page of your repository. Written in Markdown, it explains what your project does, how to use it, and how to contribute.</p>

            <h3>Issues</h3>
            <p>Bug reports, feature requests, and discussion threads. Each issue has a number (#1, #2, etc.) for easy reference.</p>

            <h3>Pull Requests</h3>
            <p>Proposed changes to the codebase. Includes code review, discussion, and automated testing.</p>

            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>Automated workflows—run tests, deploy code, generate documentation automatically.</p>

            <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
            <p>Free static website hosting directly from your repository. Perfect for project documentation or personal sites.</p>

            <h2>GitHub Alternatives</h2>
            
            <p>While we focus on GitHub, alternatives exist:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GitLab:</strong> Similar features, focus on DevOps, can self-host</li>
                <li><strong>Bitbucket:</strong> Atlassian product, integrates with Jira</li>
                <li><strong>Gitea:</strong> Lightweight, self-hosted option</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>GitHub is most popular, especially for open source, so we'll use it for training.</p>

            <h2>GitHub Pricing</h2>
            
            <p>GitHub offers:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free:</strong> Unlimited public/private repositories, core features</li>
                <li><strong>Pro:</strong> $4/month, advanced tools, more Actions minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Team/Enterprise:</strong> For organizations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The free tier is perfect for learning and most personal projects.</p>
